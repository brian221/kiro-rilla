# Product Overview

## Gorilla Kiro Game

A browser-based artillery game inspired by the classic Gorilla.bas. Two players take turns throwing goo blobs at each other across a randomly generated cityscape. Players stand on buildings of varying heights and use angle/force meters to aim their shots. The first player to land 5 hits wins.

## Core Gameplay
- Turn-based artillery mechanics with bouncing angle (0-90°) and force (0-100%) meters
- Random building generation creates unique maps each round
- Physics-based projectile motion with gravity
- Visual and audio feedback for player actions (screen shake, particles, sound effects)
- Kiro logo used as player sprites when available
